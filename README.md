# FAIR WARNING!
Any path you enter into the console of this program, that file/path will be deleted.
Be careful not to enter your main drive or other important paths like system32 into the console.
I added two checks for paths, but there is no way in hell I am spending the time to hard code every possible path to avoid deleting.

So the responsibility is on you if your files get deleted by using this program.

Simply modify the program to avoid paths you don't want deleted or don't use this program if you don't want to take that risk.


# FileKillerSharp
Delete any file no matter the cost to your PC's health, by forcing the programs using the file to be closed and the file deleted after as many attempts to delete as it takes.
